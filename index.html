                    <p>New York state, and New York City specifcially, has the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/the-size-of-the-u-s-jewish-population/"> largest population in the Jewish diaspora</a>. Unfortunately, it's still not always the safest place for Jewish people -- and especially so since the Hamas committed its' most recent massacre and terroist attack against Israel on October 7th.  Despite the fact that, at least <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/10/israel-revises-death-toll-from-october-7-hamas-attack-to-1200-people">1,200 Israelis were murdered</a>, at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-special-forces-recover-body-hostage-gaza-army-2023-12-15/#:~:text=Israel%20said%20240%20people%20were,7%20and%20killed%201%2C200%20people."> 240 people were kidnapped</a>, and untold acts of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hamas-israel-witnesses-evidence-show-sexual-violence-oct-7-terror-attack/"> sexual violence.</a> were commited, anti-Jewish sentiments have risen to <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-reports-unprecedented-rise-antisemitic-incidents-post-oct-7"> "unprecedented"</a> levels.  

                    <p>Whether or not you agree with how Israel has responded, the violence against Jewish people in New York and the promulgation of anti-semitic and anti-Jewish views <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/31/politics/antisemitism-unstable-world-analysis/index.html"> "threatens to rock an already unstable world"</a> and especially so as  <a href="https://humanrightsfirst.org/library/extremism-fact-sheet-antisemitic-conspiracy-theories/"> anti-Semitic and anti-Jewish conspiracy theories</a> go mainstream, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2021-01-29/ty-article/.highlight/jewish-groups-call-for-republican-lawmakers-removal-over-space-lasers-conspiracy/0000017f-dc3f-d856-a37f-fdff00140000"> get political platforms</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/story-trumps-explosive-dinner-ye-nick-fuentes-rcna59010"> access</a> to the White House.

                   <p>According to the official <a href="https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjg1NWI3YjgtYzkzOS00Nzc0LTkwMDAtNTgzM2I2M2JmYWE1IiwidCI6IjJiOWY1N2ViLTc4ZDEtNDZmYi1iZTgzLWEyYWZkZDdjNjA0MyJ9">NYPD Hate Crimes Dashboard</a>, 131 of 197 reported hate crimes across <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/p00095/nypd-citywide-crime-statistics-october-2023"> October</a> and <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/p00097/nypd-citywide-crime-statistics-november-2023#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20bias%20incidents,72)."> November</a> incidents were anti-Jewish, with fifteen anti-Muslim hate crimes being the second most in October and hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation was second in November with 11. By comparison, in October, there were 62 incidents against Jewish people and 69 in November. Evidently, this represents an overall 124% increase in hate crimes according to <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/11/08/hate-crimes-spike-by-124--in-october--nypd-says-">NY1</a>.</p>

                    
            
            <p>At the same, it's important to remember to note that hate crimes, like with incidents of <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/sexual-assault-remains-dramatically-underreported"> sexual violence</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/report-black-people-are-still-killed-police-higher-rate-groups-rcna17169">  police brutality</a> reporting and processing the data can be complicated, to say the least.</p>  
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Many victims of hate crimes are reluctant to report them to the police. And reported crimes do not always lead to arrests, prosecutions or even a record of hate crimes.” - <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/politics/millions-are-victims-of-hate-crimes-though-many-never-report-them/">

            <p>An analysis of publically available data provided by the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Public-Safety/Hate-Crimes-by-County-and-Bias-Type-Beginning-2010/6xda-q7ev"> New York Division of Criminal Justice Services</a> additionally reveals that between 2010 and 2022, approximately 44.75% of all reported hate crimes in NYC have been classified as anti-Jewish with the second largest classification being anti-Black at 8.86%.  To be sure, while there are limitations to these statistics given the challenges victims face in the wake of these incidents, the seriousness of the issue and the need for continued efforts to combat anti-Semitism and all hate crimes in New York City, across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/16/hate-crimes-increasing-fbi-report">the U.S.</a>, and <a href="httpshttps://time.com/5947862/anti-asian-attacks-rising-worldwide/">worldwide</a>.</p> </article>
