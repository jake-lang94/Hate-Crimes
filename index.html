                    <p>The rise in anti-Jewish hate crimes and incidents in New York City, particularly following the events of October 7th, is raising significant concerns. According to the official <a href="https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjg1NWI3YjgtYzkzOS00Nzc0LTkwMDAtNTgzM2I2M2JmYWE1IiwidCI6IjJiOWY1N2ViLTc4ZDEtNDZmYi1iZTgzLWEyYWZkZDdjNjA0MyJ9">NYPD Hate Crimes Dashboard</a>  131 of 197 across <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/p00095/nypd-citywide-crime-statistics-october-2023"> October</a> and <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/p00097/nypd-citywide-crime-statistics-november-2023#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20bias%20incidents,72)."> November</a> incidents were anti-Jewish, with fifteen anti-Muslim hate crimes being the second most out of an overal 124% increase in hate crimes overall according to <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/11/08/hate-crimes-spike-by-124--in-october--nypd-says-">NY1</a>.</p>

                    
            
            <p>At the same, it's important to remember to note that hate crimes, like with incidents of <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/sexual-assault-remains-dramatically-underreported"> sexual violence</a>, reporting can be complicated.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“Many victims of hate crimes are reluctant to report them to the police. And reported crimes do not always lead to arrests, prosecutions or even a record of hate crimes.” - <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/politics/millions-are-victims-of-hate-crimes-though-many-never-report-them/">
            The Center For Public Integrity</a></p> 
            </blockquote>

            <p>An analysis of publically available data provided ny the New York Division of Criminal Justice Services additionally reveals that between 2010 and 2022, approximately 40.44% of all hate crimes across the state and 44.75% in NYC have been classified as anti-Jewish. It's clear with statistics like this, the seriousness of the issue and the need for continued efforts to combat anti-Semitism and all hate crimes in New York City and beyond.</p> </article>
